Finite Automata
M = (states, alphabets, transitions, initial state, final states)

M : array of Object class to store different class objects
states: HashSet<String> no duplicate allowed
alphabets: HashSet<Character> no duplication
transitions: HashMap<state, HashMap<alphabet, state>>
initial state: String belongs to states
final state : HashSet<String> belongs to set


methods to implement
a. State
1. create state
2. delete state
3. rename state
4. make initial state
5. make final state

b. Transitions
1. make transition
2. add alphabets
3. change alphabets
4. delete transition
